# The Quiet Year

The Quiet Year by Avery Alder is one of my favorite games of all time. From the official website —

“The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a community living after the collapse of civilization, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.

The game is played using a deck of cards — each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events — bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.

The Quiet Year occupies an interesting space — part roleplaying game, part cartographic poetry.”

Because of these unique elements, The Quiet Year's gameplay needs are VERY different from D&D and other dice-based adventure games that Roll20, the free and wonderful online TTRPG platform, was developed for. Its needs are all communal — all information is meant to be shared, and the more clarity available, the better.

This app seeks to create an online user experience that echos the feeling of playing with friends using pen and paper.

## Development

This app is currently under development and will continue to grow as I learn more about JavaScript frameworks.
   * What's coming next? My immediate plans are...
    - Ability to create and save games
    - Icons instead of labels for whiteboard
    - Card order logged in journal, saved in game object
and, as I go on, whatever needs to happen to create a fun and seamless play experience!
